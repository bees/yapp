#Yet Another Podcast Player 

A simple podcatcher web app built with Vue.js, MIT licensed.  Currently this is pre-alpha quality software, with a minimal state of functionality. A website will be launched when it is a more complete state


## Why?

To my knowledge, there are no open source podcast players with full web interfaces (closest thing I can think of is gPodder's directory). I wanted a chance to develop my frontend skills so this seemed like an appropriate project. If there is enough use/interest, I will work on making desktop and mobile clients (Cordova/Electron clients).


## Feedback + Contributing

I am absolutely a novice, this project will likely be riddled with anti-patterns and head scratching code - if I did something stupid, the worst thing you can do is not let me know! You don't have to be nice - I am not my code, all I ask is that you give me something actionable:

'This project is garbage' - I wish I knew why!

'This project is garbage, and here's why: ...' - Much better!

'This section is garbage, and here's why: ..., here's a better approach: ...' - Perfect ðŸ‘ŒðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥


PR's are absolutely welcome, unfortunately I don't have any coding standard or style guides for reference, that will change in the near future. If you are interested in collaborating, just let me know!
